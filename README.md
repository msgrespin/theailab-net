# IPHS 400: Frontiers in AI

**Kenyon College — Integrated Program for Humane Studies (IPHS) — Fall 2026**

Course website for IPHS 400, a hands-on study of AI software engineering (AI-SWE):
configuring, extending, and orchestrating AI coding agents through a professional
software development lifecycle. This repository contains the site's source and
its test suite; course submissions, quizzes, and grades are handled separately
on Moodle.

- **Instructor:** Jon Chun
- **Schedule:** Tu/Th, 2:40–4:00 PM · Timberlake #5 (Evans Conference Room)

This is a self-contained static site: it runs from a local web server with no
build step, no deploy pipeline, and no external hosting configuration.

```

The site is static HTML/CSS with no build step or JS framework. Every page
shares one stylesheet and a common header/nav/hero/footer skeleton.

## Local Development

Serve the site locally with Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080/
```

No install step is required to view the site — only the test suite has
dependencies.

## Running the Tests

The test suite (pytest + BeautifulSoup/lxml) validates structural and content
integrity of every page:

- `test_unit_html_structure.py` — every page has a DOCTYPE, title, stylesheet
  link, header, footer, and hero `<h1>`; no leftover template branding; no
  placeholder or stub content
- `test_integration_links.py` — every internal link resolves; navigation is
  identical across all pages; the schedule links to all 15 week pages
- `test_e2e_site.py` — required files/directories exist; exact page count;
  every page is reachable from `index.html` (no orphaned pages)

```bash
uv venv --python=3.12          # or: python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r tests/requirements.txt   # or: pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

Re-run `source .venv/bin/activate` in each new terminal session before running
the tests.

Run a single test file or test:

```bash
pytest tests/test_unit_html_structure.py -v
pytest tests/test_integration_links.py::TestNavConsistency::test_nav_links_resolve -v
```

## Deployment

None. This is a standalone static site with no deploy pipeline — serve it
locally with the command in [Local Development](#local-development). To host it
elsewhere, any static file host will serve the repository root as-is.

## Content Source and Provenance

All course content (syllabus text, schedule, assignments, policies) is
sourced from the official Fall 2026 syllabus. The page layout, navigation
pattern, and stylesheet are adapted from a prior Kenyon course site (a
"Twenty Nineteen"-style layout used across Jon Chun's Kenyon course sites)
for visual consistency; no course content from that site is reused here.

The site is also reachable at **theailab.net**.

## Mini-Project 1 — Website Revision Notes

*Submitted by Maggie Grespin, IPHS 400, Fall 2026.*

### Generative AI Use Statement

I used **Claude Code (Sonnet 5, thinking effort medium)** for this project.
The agent did the critique, wrote the tech-spec, made every code and content
edit, wrote the tests, and drafted the supporting docs. I directed the work
and made the judgment calls described below. No other AI tools were used.
Artifacts of the AI work: `docs/iphs400_mp1-web-redesign_critique_maggie-grespin_20260901.md`
(critique), `docs/iphs400_mp1-web-redesign_tech-spec_maggie-grespin_20260903.md` (plan), `CHANGELOG.md`
(result), and the per-task commit history on the `web-revision-v1` branch.

### Submission Documents

- **`iphs400_mp1-web-redesign_report_maggie-grespin_20260910.md`** — Assignment report
  covering design direction and resources used
- **`PROCESS.md`** — Detailed documentation of all decisions made, methodology,
  and the reasoning behind each choice
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — Complete list of technical changes

Test suite: 51 checks (up from 25 in the original). Run `pytest tests/` to verify.
